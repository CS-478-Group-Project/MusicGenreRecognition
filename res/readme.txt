Here's how to use the scraper:

> pip install -r requirements.txt
> python playlist_scraper.py

The script will take around 10-15 mins to run, depending on your internet connection.
It gathers 40-50 songs for each genre.  You can run it multiple times, and it will skip songs that have already been downloaded.

Feel free to add more playlists in the config.json if you want.
